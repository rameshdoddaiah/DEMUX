Task is to classify heatbeat recordings into 1 of 5 classes.

Heartbeat recordings were gathered from both the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app and from clinical trials using the the digital stethoscope DigiScope.
The time series represent the change in amplitude over time during an examination of patients suffering from common arrhythmias.
All instances were resampled to 4,000Hz and truncated to the shortest instance length.
